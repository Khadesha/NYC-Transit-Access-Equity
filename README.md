# Introduction
The first train lines in New York City opened by mayor George McCellan in October of 1904. The goal was to connect several places along lower Manhattan to Midtown at the Grand Central Terminal. With that first opening, it allowed for an evolution of transit lines across all boroughs giving people the opportunity to access jobs and other major services like healthcare. Significantly improving our quality of life.
However, due to issues like red lining, certain areas of New York City labeled ‘low income’ tend to become target to transit disparities. Subway pollution, (transit) lines with extensive waiting times, and congestion lower the improving quality of life it was originally made for. 
With major gaps between high- and low-income areas, we want to include maps that visualize where transit systems run based on income, charts that reference to BOTH  transit users income and pollution (air quality index, noise, etc), and images to show how each high and low income areas are affected joblessness because of it. Seeing that will give us a better understanding of how there are distinctions in quality of life in low income and affluent neighborhoods.

### Methods
-	Research when and where the first public train were built in NYC 
-	Research why did they decide to make a public transit system and why in that specific location 
-	Research how has the transit system expanded
-	Research how accessible are subway public transportation based on money and location
-	Compare transit coverage in affluent vs. low-income neighborhoods
-	Research how transit has it helped and/or harmed New York City affluent and low-income areas via job, accessibility and/or pollution
